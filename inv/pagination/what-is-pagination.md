# What is Pagination?
Pagination is a technique used to divide a large list of items into smaller "pages". This is useful when you have a large number of items to display, but you don't want to overwhelm the user with a long list of items. Instead, you can display a smaller number of items on each page, and allow the user to navigate between pages to see more items.

But in the context of Minecraft, you have to have in mind that the game inventory can only display up to 9 * 6 = 54 items at once. So, if you have more than 54 items to display, you will need to implement pagination to allow the user to see all the items.
