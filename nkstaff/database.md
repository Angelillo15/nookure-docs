# What database is the best for you?

We have 3 types of messenger

| Type   | Only one server | Network | MultiProxy Network |
| ------ | --------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| MySQL  | ✅              | ✅      | ✅                 |
| SQlite | ✅              | ❌      | ❌                 |

## MySQl

This is the best database when you have a network or you have an only one server but you want to scale it in the future.

## SQlite

This is the best database when you have an only one server and you don't want to scale it in the future.
