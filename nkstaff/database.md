# Which database is the best for you?

Nookure Staff can use 2 different types of database:

| Type   | Single server | Network | MultiProxy network |
| ------ | --------------- | ------- | ------------------ |
| MySQL  | ✅              | ✅      | ✅                 |
| SQlite | ✅              | ❌      | ❌                 |

## MySQL

This is the best database when you have a network or you have only one server but you want to scale it in the future. You will require a hosting that provides MySQL databases to use this option.

## SQLite

This is the best database when you have an only one server and you don't want to scale it in the future. This will store the plugin data in a .db file inside the plugin folder.
