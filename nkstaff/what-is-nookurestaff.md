| Staff Mode    | This mode restricts staff members from impacting the server state unless they have special permissions, while still granting them access to valuable moderation tools.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Vanish        | The vanish state can be activated by staff members using a command or while in Staff Mode, rendering them invisible to regular players. This feature enables staff to spectate players discreetly, monitor for hacks, and ensure compliance with server rules.                                                                                                                        |
| Freeze        | This tool enables staff members to freeze players and display a message in the chat. It can be particularly useful when staff need to conduct a screenshare on a user to verify if they are cheating.                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Staff Chat    | The Staff Chat feature provides a private communication channel for online staff members within the Minecraft server, allowing them to interact with each other discreetly without using the public chat.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Multi Server  | This plugin is not only capable of running on an independent Minecraft server but is also compatible with Proxy synchronization. This compatibility enables simultaneous usage across multiple servers, facilitating communication of certain plugin features between the backend servers.                                                                                            |
| Multi Proxy   | Nookure Staff is compatible with Proxy synchronization for multi-server use and seamlessly operates on multiple proxies with Redis integration. This allows efficient communication and synchronization of plugin functions across different proxy servers, enhancing scalability and performance in complex server setups.                                                           |
| Customization | Nookure Staff offers extensively customizable configuration files that allow for precise adjustments to every aspect of the plugin. Messages, items, and commands can be effortlessly modified within seconds. Additionally, the plugin boasts a variety of features that can be selectively enabled or disabled to tailor the user experience and ensure optimal server performance. |
